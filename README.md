# API test

## Getting started - start the server

  * Clone this repo
  * `npm install`
  * `npm run server`

You should see something like this:

```
Loading db.json
  Done

  Resources
  http://localhost:3000/customers
  http://localhost:3000/comments
  http://localhost:3000/profile

  Home
  http://localhost:3000

  Type s + enter at any time to create a snapshot of the database
```

At this point you have a simple API server running, now let's move on to running Postman against it
